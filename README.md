**Project Overview:**
This project demonstrate complete workflow integrating SQL Server, Microsoft Power BI, and Machine Learning to analyze customer churn. From data extraction and transformation (ETL) to insightful visualization and predictive modeling, this project provides actionable strategies to enhance customer retention.

**In this project, the Key Objectives:**
1. ETL Process in SQL Server
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
3. Advanced Data Transformations in Power BI
4. Dynamic Visualizations and Enhanced Reporting
5. Predictive Modeling using Random Forest
6. Integration of Predicted Data for Strategic Insights

**Challenges Addressed**
- Competitive business environment necessitates effective customer retention strategies.
- Churn Analysis helps understand and reduce customer attrition by examining patterns and reasons for     customer departures.

## Task:

1. **ETL Process in SQL Server:**
- Imported data from source files into SQL Server to ensure data handling and integrity.
- Cleaned datasets by identifying and addressing missing values, ensuring data quality for accurate analysis.
- Created SQL views to simplify complex queries.

**2.Data Cleaning in SQL Server:**
- Identified and cleaned the data to prevent inaccuracies in analysis.
-Standardized and formatted data to ensure consistency across datasets.

**3. Power BI Transformations:**
- Utilized the Import method to seamlessly integrate data from SQL Server into Power BI.
- Applied transformations to optimize data structure for effective visualization and in-depth analysis.

**4. Power BI Visualization and Enhancement:**
- Designed an interactive visuals to represent customer data across various levels (demographics, geography,   payment patterns, account information, and service usage).
-Study Churners Profiles to identity areas for marketing campaigns.
-Created measures such total customers, total churn, Churn rate, and New Joiners.

**5. Machine Learning for Predictive Analysis:**
- Built a Random Forest model to predict future churners, using historical customer data.
- Trained the model on existing data and validated its accuracy to ensure reliable predictions.
- Download the predicted data in CSV format.

**6. Dashboard for Future Churners:**
- Imported CSV files containing predicted churn data into Power BI.
- An executive summary for analyzing historical data.
- A dedicated prediction page forecasting future churn trends.

## Results

- Delivered an in-depth Power BI dashboard that effectively visualizes and analyzes customer data.
- Implemented a churn prediction model using Random Forest, enabling foresight into customer behavior.
- Enabled proactive steps to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.
- Provided actionable insights to design targeted marketing campaigns to reducing churn rates.
- Improved ability to predict and understand customer behaviour and developed a valuable tool for customer retention and business growth.
